# Gaming with Accelerometer
Sample source code for DIY PR3. Project description : This PIC microcontroller based project reveal the usage of ADXL 330 as a gravity or acceleration sensor. The result will display in the position of ball in GLCD.
There is sample game provided to explain how to use the ADXL 330. This project started to use higher end PIC microcontroller, which is PIC18F452.Compatible with MPLAB IDE with HITECH C compiler, MPLABX with HITECH C compiler v9.83/v9.82/v9.80 and XC8 compiler.

There is 3 folder which are Source code(.c), Sample code using MPLABX and sample code using MPLAB(Using MPLAB 8.6 And HiTech 9.80). Welcome to our tecnical forum for any inquiry. http://forum.cytron.com.my/
